# Bayesian Data Analysis for Statistical Causal Inference: An Introductory Seminar

[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/JulianFrattini/bda-intro)](./LICENSE)

This repository contains the material for the introduction seminar to Bayesian Data Analysis (BDA) for Statistical Causal Inference (SCI).
The purpose of the seminar is to introduce software engineering researchers with a background in analysis of quantitative data to a causal framework and Bayesian approach as proposed by Judea Pearl[^1] and Richard McElreath[^2].

## Structure

The repository contains the following directories and files.

- slides/ : directory with all presentation slides and files
  - series/ : slides for an interactive three-part series of the seminar
- src/ : source code to follow along the examples
  - html/ : a pre-compiled version of all `Rmd` files (using `knitr`) for easier viewing
  - `colliders.Rmd` : demonstration of the effect of a collider
  - `dags.Rmd` : demonstration of specifying causal directed acyclic graphs
  - `forks.Rmd` : demonstration of the effect of a fork
  - `mediators.Rmd` : demonstration of the effect of a mediator

## System Requirements

In order to run the `R` scripts and `Rmd` notebooks in the _src_ folder, ensure that you have [R](https://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/CRAN/) (version > 4.0) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download) installed on your machine.
Then, ensure the following steps:

1. Install the `rstan` toolchain by following the instructions for [Windows](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/Configuring-C---Toolchain-for-Windows#r40), [Mac OS](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/Configuring-C---Toolchain-for-Mac), or [Linux](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/Configuring-C-Toolchain-for-Linux) respectively.
2. Restart RStudio and follow the instructions starting with the [Installation of RStan](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started#installation-of-rstan)
3. Install the latest version of `stan` by running the following commands
```R
    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("stan-dev/cmdstanr")
    cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
```
4. Install all required packages via `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "dagitty", "ggdag", "brms", "posterior", "bayesplot", "marginaleffects", "broom.mixed", "patchwork"))`.
5. Create a folder called *fits* within *src/* such that `brms` has a location to place all Bayesian models.
6. Open the `bda-intro.Rproj` file with RStudio which will setup the environment correctly.
